# Project Overview

## Executive Summary

ARCA API is a modern REST API platform that simplifies Argentina's complex electronic invoicing system. It transforms AFIP's legacy SOAP services into a developer-friendly interface, complete with AI-powered features, multi-language SDKs, and a generous free tier. The platform targets developers, business owners, and agencies who need reliable, easy-to-integrate invoicing solutions.

## What Does It Do?

### Core Functionality

**Electronic Invoice Generation**
- Create invoices compliant with AFIP regulations
- Support for invoice types: A (IVA inscripto), B (monotributo), C (final consumer), M (monotributo)
- Automatic tax calculations (IVA, percepciones, retenciones)
- Real-time submission to AFIP
- CAE (Código de Autorización Electrónico) retrieval
- Invoice cancellation and correction

**Authentication & Certificate Management**
- Automatic AFIP authentication using certificates
- X.509 certificate handling (no manual management needed)
- Token refresh and session management
- API key and JWT-based authentication for clients
- Secure credential storage

**Developer Tools**
- RESTful JSON API (modern alternative to AFIP's SOAP)
- Interactive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Multi-language SDKs with idiomatic code
- Sandbox environment for testing
- Request/response logging and debugging tools
- Webhook notifications for invoice events

**AI-Powered Features** (Phase 2)
- Natural language invoice creation
  - Input: "Invoice Juan for consulting $5000"
  - Output: Complete, AFIP-compliant invoice
- Smart field completion
- Intelligent tax calculations
- OCR for receipt digitization (future)

**Integrations**
- E-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce)
- Argentine marketplaces (Mercado Libre, Tienda Nube)
- Accounting software (future)
- Custom webhooks
- Third-party apps via API

**Dashboard**
- Invoice management (list, view, search, filter)
- API key management
- Usage analytics and statistics
- Account and billing settings
- Team management (paid tiers)
- Reports and exports
