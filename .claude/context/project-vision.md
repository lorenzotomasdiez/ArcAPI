## Commitment

This vision guides all decisions. When in doubt:
1. Does this improve developer experience?
2. Does this advance our AI capabilities?
3. Does this help us scale globally?
4. Does this strengthen our community?
5. Does this make compliance easier?

If yes to any → proceed. If no to all → reconsider.

## The Ultimate Goal

**In 10 years**:
When a developer anywhere in Latin America thinks "I need to handle invoicing", their first thought is: **"Use ARCA API"**

Not because they have to, but because it's the obvious choice.

That's success.
