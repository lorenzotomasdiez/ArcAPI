# PRD: Engineering Documentation System

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the **Engineering Documentation System** for the ARCA API platform - a comprehensive, technology-agnostic documentation framework designed to support a complex, multi-service SaaS product from inception through scale.

The documentation system will enable a **spec-driven development** (SDD) approach with emphasis on architecture-first thinking, ensuring high availability, scalability, and cost optimization from day one. All documentation will be markdown-based, version-controlled alongside code, and structured to meet Google Engineering standards for quality and rigor.

**Key Objectives:**
- Define system architecture for high-availability, scalable, cost-effective platform
- Establish spec-driven development workflow with clear contracts between services
- Create comprehensive technical specifications for 8+ interconnected services
- Provide visual system flows using Mermaid diagrams
- Enable engineering team collaboration with clear, discoverable documentation
- Maintain technology-agnostic approach allowing flexibility in implementation choices

**Success Criteria:**
- Documentation approved by Google Engineering team standards
- Zero ambiguity in service contracts and API specifications
- New engineers can understand complete system architecture within 2 days
- All system flows documented with visual diagrams
- Documentation stays current through automated validation

## Problem Statement

### What Problem Are We Solving?

Building ARCA API requires coordinating **8+ interconnected services** (REST API, Dashboard, SDKs, AI services, MCP server, integrations, webhooks, analytics) with complex interactions, external dependencies (ARCA SOAP API), and stringent requirements for availability, security, and compliance.

**Without comprehensive engineering documentation:**

1. **Architecture Drift**: Services built without cohesive architectural vision lead to scalability issues, security gaps, and technical debt
2. **Integration Failures**: Undefined service contracts cause broken integrations, deployment failures, and production incidents
3. **Knowledge Silos**: Critical system knowledge trapped in individual developers' heads creates bus factor risks
4. **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different approaches to common problems (auth, error handling, logging) across services
5. **Slow Onboarding**: New engineers take weeks to understand system, delaying velocity
6. **Regulatory Risk**: Undocumented security/compliance decisions create audit failures and legal exposure
7. **Cost Overruns**: Unplanned architecture leads to over-provisioning or emergency scaling

### Why Is This Important Now?

We are at **Day Zero** of the ARCA API platform. This is the **critical window** where architectural decisions have maximum leverage and minimum cost to implement correctly.

**Timing is critical because:**
- Pre-code phase: Can define optimal architecture without refactoring costs
- Spec-driven development: Write contracts before implementation prevents rework
- Team formation: Documentation establishes shared mental models from day one
- Regulatory compliance: GDPR, AFIP requirements must be architected in, not bolted on
- Investor confidence: Professional documentation demonstrates execution maturity

### Current State

**What exists:**
- `prd-idea.md`: Comprehensive product vision (27K tokens) covering business requirements, features, market analysis
- `.claude/context/*.md`: High-level context files (product, tech, vision, patterns)
- Zero architecture documentation
- Zero technical specifications
- Zero service contracts
- Zero deployment plans

**Gap:** We have **what to build** (product PRD) but lack **how to build it** (engineering documentation).

## Proposed Solution: Spec-Driven Development Framework

### Development Methodology: Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

**Definition**: Spec-Driven Development is an approach where detailed specifications (contracts, schemas, interfaces) are written **before** implementation code, serving as executable contracts that drive development, testing, and validation.

**Why SDD for ARCA API?**

1. **Parallel Development**: Frontend, backend, and SDK teams can work simultaneously using specs as contracts
2. **Contract Testing**: APIs tested against specs before and after implementation
3. **Documentation as Code**: Specs are both documentation and validation artifacts
4. **Change Management**: Spec changes trigger impact analysis before code changes
5. **Clear Handoffs**: Designers → Spec → Implementation → Testing all reference same source of truth

### SDD Workflow

### Flow Documentation Template

```markdown
# User Flow: Invoice Creation (Simple Mode)

## Overview
User creates invoice using natural language description, AI generates structured invoice, system submits to ARCA.

## Actors
- **API Consumer**: Developer's application
- **ARCA API**: Our platform
- **OpenAI**: AI service
- **ARCA/AFIP**: Government tax system

## Preconditions
- User authenticated with valid API key
- User has uploaded ARCA certificate
- User has credit balance or active subscription

## Flow Diagram

```mermaid

    actor User as API Consumer
    participant API as ARCA API
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant AI as AI Service

        Note over API: Background job<br/>will retry
    end
```

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Authentication (50ms)
- API gateway validates Bearer token format
- Auth service lookups API key hash in database
- Returns user_id and rate limit tier
- **Failure**: 401 Unauthorized if invalid

### 2. Rate Limiting Check (10ms)
- Check Redis counter for user's requests in current minute
- Free tier: 100 req/min, Pro: 1000 req/min
- Increment counter with 60s TTL
- **Failure**: 429 Rate Limited if exceeded

### 3. Credit Balance Check (20ms)
- Query user's remaining invoice credits
- Free tier: 500/month, paid tiers unlimited
- **Failure**: 402 Payment Required if exhausted

### 4. AI Invoice Generation (500-1500ms)
- Send description + user context (past invoices, preferences) to AI service
- AI service calls OpenAI GPT-4 with specialized prompt
- Parse response into structured invoice
- Apply business rules (IVA rates, defaults)
- **Failure**: 500 Internal Error if AI service down → fallback to manual mode

### 5. Structure Validation (30ms)
- Validate generated structure against JSON schema
- Check CUIT format, invoice type validity
- Verify totals match items
- **Failure**: 400 Bad Request if validation fails

### 6. Database Persistence (40ms)
- Insert invoice record with status=pending
- Store AI-generated metadata for auditing
- Return invoice UUID
- **Failure**: 500 Internal Error if DB down

### 7. ARCA Authentication (100ms, cached)
- Check Redis for valid ARCA token
- If missing/expired: request new token with user's certificate
- Cache token for 11 hours with 10-hour TTL
- **Failure**: Retry 3x with exponential backoff → 503 Service Unavailable

### 8. ARCA Invoice Submission (1000-3000ms)
- Convert structured invoice to SOAP XML
- Call ARCA FECAESolicitar endpoint
- Parse XML response
- **Failure scenarios**:
  - **Validation error**: 400 Bad Request (client's fault)
  - **ARCA down**: 503 Service Unavailable (retry later)
  - **Timeout**: 202 Accepted (background retry)

### 9. Response & Webhook (50ms)
- Update invoice status in database
- Trigger webhook if configured
- Return response to client
- **Async**: PDF generation, email sending queued

## Success Criteria
- Invoice created with status=approved
- CAE received from ARCA
- Response time P95 <3 seconds (including ARCA latency)

## Error Handling
| Error | Status Code | Retry? | User Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Invalid API key | 401 | No | Check API key |
| Rate limited | 429 | Yes | Wait 60s or upgrade tier |
| Invalid input | 400 | No | Fix request |
| AI service down | 500 | No | Use advanced mode |
| ARCA validation error | 400 | No | Check CUIT, invoice data |
| ARCA timeout | 202 | Yes (auto) | Poll invoice status |
| ARCA down | 503 | Yes | Retry in 5min |

## Performance Targets
- **Total latency**: P50 <2s, P95 <4s, P99 <6s
- **Breakdown**:
  - Auth + validation: 100ms
  - AI generation: 1s (P50), 2s (P95)
  - ARCA call: 1s (P50), 2s (P95)
  - Other: 100ms

## Monitoring
- **Metrics**:
  - Invoice creation rate (per minute)
  - Success rate (% with CAE)
  - AI generation latency (histogram)
  - ARCA call latency (histogram)
  - Error rate by type (counter)
- **Alerts**:
  - Error rate >5% (1min window) → page on-call
  - P95 latency >6s (5min window) → investigate
  - ARCA down (3 failures) → status page update
```

# ADR-001: Database Selection for ARCA API

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Author**: Tech Lead
**Reviewers**: Engineering Team, Google Engineering Advisor

## Context

ARCA API requires a primary database for storing invoice data, user accounts, API keys, and operational metadata. The database must support:

- **Transactional integrity**: Invoice creation is multi-step (save → ARCA call → update)
- **Full-text search**: Users search invoices by customer name, description
- **JSON storage**: Flexible metadata and ARCA response storage
- **High availability**: 99.95% uptime target
- **Scalability**: Support 1M+ invoices in Year 1, 10M+ in Year 3
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Optimize for startup budget

## Decision

We will use **PostgreSQL 15** as the primary database.

**Deployment**: Managed service (AWS RDS or Supabase) with automated backups, read replicas, and point-in-time recovery.

## Rationale

### Why PostgreSQL?

**Strengths:**
1. **ACID compliance**: Guarantees data integrity for financial transactions
2. **Rich feature set**: JSONB, full-text search (tsvector), array types, CTEs
3. **Proven scalability**: Handles billions of rows with proper indexing and partitioning
4. **Strong ecosystem**: Mature ORMs (Prisma, TypeORM, SQLAlchemy), tools, monitoring
5. **Cost-effective**: Open source, managed options from $20/month (Supabase) to $50/month (RDS)
6. **Full-text search**: Built-in tsvector avoids need for separate search service initially
7. **JSON support**: JSONB for flexible metadata and ARCA responses

**Alignment with requirements:**
- ✅ ACID for invoice integrity
- ✅ Full-text search with tsvector (Spanish language support)
- ✅ JSONB for flexible fields
- ✅ 99.95% uptime with RDS Multi-AZ or Supabase high-availability
- ✅ Horizontal read scaling with read replicas
- ✅ Cost: $50-200/month for Year 1 scale

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: MongoDB
**Pros:**
- Flexible schema
- Horizontal sharding built-in
- Good for rapid prototyping

**Cons:**
- ❌ No multi-document ACID transactions in sharded clusters (critical for invoices)
- ❌ Full-text search less mature than PostgreSQL
- ❌ Higher cost at scale (Atlas pricing)
- ❌ Financial/compliance use cases favor relational

**Verdict**: Schema flexibility not worth losing ACID guarantees for financial data.

#### Alternative 2: MySQL
**Pros:**
- ACID compliant
- Wide adoption
- Cost-effective

**Cons:**
- ❌ Weaker JSON support than PostgreSQL (JSON not JSONB)
- ❌ Full-text search less powerful (no advanced language support)
- ❌ Less rich feature set (no CTEs until MySQL 8, no array types)

**Verdict**: PostgreSQL's superior JSON and full-text search outweigh MySQL's simplicity.

#### Alternative 3: DynamoDB
**Pros:**
- Fully managed, serverless
- Infinite scalability
- Low latency

**Cons:**
- ❌ No joins: complex queries require application-level logic
- ❌ No full-text search: requires separate OpenSearch
- ❌ More expensive at low scale (read/write capacity units)
- ❌ ACID only within single partition: invoice integrity harder

**Verdict**: Premature optimization for scale we don't need yet; SQL flexibility critical early.

### Technology Stack Alignment
- **Backend (Node.js)**: Excellent PostgreSQL support via `pg` driver, Prisma ORM
- **AI Service (Python)**: Strong support via `psycopg3`, SQLAlchemy, asyncpg
- **TypeScript**: Prisma provides best-in-class type safety

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Single database for all relational data (no polyglot persistence initially)
- ✅ Built-in full-text search avoids Elasticsearch cost/complexity
- ✅ JSONB allows schema evolution without migrations for metadata
- ✅ Strong consistency guarantees for financial data
- ✅ Mature backup/recovery (point-in-time recovery)
- ✅ Read replicas for scaling reads (analytics, reporting)

### Negative
- ⚠️ Vertical scaling limits (though ~1M transactions/day achievable on single instance)
- ⚠️ Full-text search not as powerful as Elasticsearch (may need to migrate in Year 2-3 at scale)
- ⚠️ Requires careful index management for performance

### Mitigation Strategies

**Scaling concerns:**
- Start with connection pooling (PgBouncer) to maximize single-instance efficiency
- Partition invoices table by user_id or time after 10M records
- Add read replicas for analytics/reporting queries
- Evaluate sharding or move to Citus/Yugabyte if single-node limits reached (Year 3+)

**Full-text search limitations:**
- Monitor search query performance
- If search becomes bottleneck (>500ms P95), migrate to Elasticsearch/Typesense
- Design search schema to be Elasticsearch-compatible from day one (easy migration)

**Operational complexity:**
- Use managed service (RDS/Supabase) to avoid operational burden
- Automate backups, monitoring, alerting from day one
- Budget for DBA consultation if performance issues arise

## Compliance & Security

- **GDPR**: PostgreSQL supports row-level security for data isolation, encryption at rest
- **Audit logs**: Triggers for change data capture
- **Backup**: Automated daily backups with 30-day retention (RDS) meets compliance

## Cost Estimation

**Year 1 (0-2K users, 300K invoices/month):**
- Supabase Pro: $25/month + usage = ~$50/month
- AWS RDS db.t4g.small: ~$30/month instance + $20/month storage + backups = ~$60/month

**Year 2 (5K users, 1M invoices/month):**
- AWS RDS db.t4g.medium + read replica: ~$200/month

**Year 3 (20K users, 5M invoices/month):**
- AWS RDS db.r6g.large + 2 read replicas: ~$800/month

## Review & Revisit

**Review triggers:**
- Query latency P95 exceeds 500ms consistently
- Database cost exceeds 20% of infrastructure budget
- Full-text search inadequate for user needs
- Data volume exceeds 500GB (consider partitioning)

**Scheduled review**: End of Year 1 (Month 12)

This PRD defines a **comprehensive engineering documentation system** designed to support ARCA API from Day Zero through scale. The documentation framework emphasizes:

1. **Spec-Driven Development**: Specifications written before code, serving as executable contracts
2. **Technology Agnosticism**: Architecture-first thinking independent of implementation technologies
3. **Visual Communication**: Mermaid diagrams for all flows, architecture, and data movement
4. **High Availability & Scale**: Documentation of HA patterns, scaling strategies, and cost optimization
5. **Google Engineering Standards**: Rigor, completeness, and clarity meeting enterprise review standards

The system is designed to be:
- **Maintainable**: By small team without dedicated tech writers
- **Scalable**: Support growth from 8 services to 50+
- **Discoverable**: Any topic findable within 3 clicks
- **Automated**: Validated via CI/CD pipelines
- **Living**: Updated continuously alongside code

**Success means:**
- New engineers productive in <5 days
- Zero production incidents due to undocumented behavior
- Google Engineering review approval
- Documentation NPS >8/10 from team
- Architecture supporting 100K invoices/day from Day 1

**Remember**: Documentation is not a phase, it's a practice. The best time to document is before writing code. The second best time is now.
