# Work Analysis: Issue #2 - Setup Documentation Infrastructure

## Summary
Create the complete documentation directory structure and navigation system for ARCA API. This is a foundational task with no dependencies that blocks all other documentation tasks.

## Complexity: LOW
- Mostly file creation and directory structure
- Clear specification from PRD
- No external dependencies or complex logic
- Can be completed sequentially in a single pass

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Single Stream Approach (Recommended)
This task should be executed as a **single sequential stream** because:
1. Directory creation is fast and must happen before file creation
2. Files interdepend on each other (READMEs link to subdirectories)
3. Navigation testing requires complete structure
4. Total time is only 4 hours - parallelization overhead not worth it

### Stream A: Complete Documentation Infrastructure Setup
**Agent Type:** general-purpose
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours
**Priority:** CRITICAL (blocks all other tasks)

**Scope:**
- Create all directories and subdirectories
- Write main `docs/README.md` navigation hub
- Create section README files with descriptions
- Add placeholder files with TODOs
- Add .gitkeep files for empty directories
- Update project root README
- Test navigation (all links work)
- Commit changes

**Files to Create:**
```
docs/README.md                              # Main navigation hub
docs/architecture/README.md                 # Architecture docs index
docs/architecture/00-overview.md            # Placeholder
docs/architecture/01-system-context.md      # Placeholder
docs/architecture/02-services.md            # Placeholder
docs/architecture/03-data-architecture.md   # Placeholder
docs/architecture/04-infrastructure.md      # Placeholder
docs/architecture/adrs/README.md            # ADR index
docs/architecture/adrs/.gitkeep
docs/specifications/README.md               # Specs index
docs/specifications/api/README.md           # API specs guide
docs/specifications/api/.gitkeep
docs/specifications/services/README.md      # Service contracts index
docs/specifications/services/.gitkeep
docs/flows/README.md                        # Flows index
docs/flows/.gitkeep
docs/development/README.md                  # Dev docs index
docs/development/.gitkeep
docs/operations/README.md                   # Ops docs index
docs/operations/runbooks/README.md          # Runbooks index
docs/operations/runbooks/.gitkeep
docs/security/README.md                     # Security docs index
docs/security/compliance/README.md          # Compliance docs index
docs/security/compliance/.gitkeep
```

**Files to Update:**
```
README.md                                   # Add link to docs/
```

**Work Breakdown:**
1. Create directory structure (30 min)
   - Use mkdir -p for nested directories
   - Verify structure matches PRD specification

2. Write main docs/README.md (1 hour)
   - Navigation hub with links to all sections
   - Brief description of each section
   - Quick start guide for engineers
   - Reference to ARCA API project

3. Create section README files (2 hours)
   - Architecture README (describe C4 model, ADRs)
   - Specifications README (OpenAPI, service contracts)
   - Flows README (Mermaid diagrams)
   - Development README (setup, standards, testing)
   - Operations README (deployment, monitoring, runbooks)
   - Security README (architecture, compliance)
   - ADRs README (template and index)
   - Runbooks README (template and index)

4. Add placeholder files (included in step 3)
   - architecture/00-overview.md through 04-infrastructure.md
   - Each with TODO comments indicating content from PRD

5. Add .gitkeep files (5 min)
   - Ensure empty directories are tracked in Git

6. Update project root README (15 min)
   - Add "Documentation" section
   - Link to docs/README.md
   - Brief description of documentation system

7. Test navigation (20 min)
   - Click through all links
   - Verify GitHub renders markdown correctly
   - Ensure no broken links

8. Commit changes (10 min)
   - git add docs/ README.md
   - Descriptive commit message
   - Verify all files tracked

**Coordination:**
- No coordination needed (single stream, no dependencies)
- Update task status in GitHub issue when complete

**Success Criteria:**
- All directories exist
- All README files have content
- Navigation works (all links resolve)
- Project README links to documentation
- Changes committed to epic/engineering-documentation branch

**Risks:**
- NONE (low complexity, well-defined task)

## No Parallel Streams Needed

This task is too simple to benefit from parallelization. A single agent working sequentially will complete this in 4 hours with no coordination overhead.

## Estimated Total Time
- Single stream: 4 hours
- With overhead: 4.5 hours

## Next Tasks Unblocked
After completion:
- Task #3 (Write core architecture documents) - READY
- All other tasks remain blocked until Task #3 completes
