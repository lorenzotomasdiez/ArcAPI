# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #8

## Overview

Create essential operational documentation for deploying, monitoring, and troubleshooting ARCA API in production. This includes deployment guide, monitoring strategy, and critical runbooks.

**Total Work**: 10-12 hours
**With Parallelization**: 4-5 hours wall time
**Efficiency Gain**: 60% time savings

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Deployment & Infrastructure Documentation
**Scope**: Deployment guide and rollback procedures
**Files**:
- `docs/operations/deployment-guide.md` (create)
- `docs/operations/README.md` (update - add deployment section)

**Agent Type**: devops-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4.5 hours
**Dependencies**: none (references Task 002 architecture docs, but read-only)

**Deliverables**:
1. Complete deployment guide with:
   - Prerequisites and environment setup
   - Staging deployment steps (Railway)
   - Production deployment steps (Railway + GitHub Actions)
   - Database migration procedures
   - Deployment workflow diagram
   - Health check endpoints
   - Rollback procedures
2. Testing in staging environment (1.5 hours included)
3. Documentation cross-links

**Why Independent**:
- Works on deployment-specific files only
- No overlap with monitoring or runbooks
- Can test deployment process independently

### Stream B: Monitoring & Observability Documentation
**Scope**: Monitoring strategy, metrics, logging, and alerting
**Files**:
- `docs/operations/monitoring.md` (create)
- `docs/operations/README.md` (update - add monitoring section)

**Agent Type**: sre-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2.5 hours
**Dependencies**: none

**Deliverables**:
1. Complete monitoring strategy with:
   - RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration) definitions
   - Prometheus metrics implementation examples
   - Structured logging standards (JSON format)
   - OpenTelemetry distributed tracing setup
   - Alert definitions (critical vs warning)
   - SLO/SLI definitions
2. Code examples for metrics collection
3. Alert thresholds and escalation policies

**Why Independent**:
- Completely separate file from deployment guide
- Defines observability strategy independently
- No file conflicts with other streams

### Stream C: Runbooks - Incident Response
**Scope**: Critical runbooks for common production incidents
**Files**:
- `docs/operations/runbooks/arca-api-down.md` (create)
- `docs/operations/runbooks/database-issues.md` (create)
- `docs/operations/runbooks/README.md` (update - add runbook index)
- `docs/operations/README.md` (update - add runbooks section)

**Agent Type**: oncall-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream B completes (needs monitoring/alerting context)
**Estimated Hours**: 4 hours
**Dependencies**: Stream B (references alert definitions and metrics)

**Deliverables**:
1. Runbook: ARCA API Down (2 hours)
   - Symptoms, diagnosis, resolution steps
   - Circuit breaker configuration
   - Queue management for pending invoices
   - Status page updates
   - Escalation procedures
2. Runbook: Database Issues (2 hours)
   - Connection pool exhaustion diagnosis
   - Slow query identification
   - Database lock resolution
   - Index creation procedures
   - Escalation to DBA

**Why Dependent on Stream B**:
- References specific alert names defined in monitoring.md
- Uses metrics and logs defined in monitoring strategy
- Escalation thresholds tied to SLO definitions

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files

**High Coordination Required**:
- `docs/operations/README.md` - All 3 streams update this file
  - **Strategy**: Each stream creates a section, merge at end
  - Stream A: Adds "Deployment" section
  - Stream B: Adds "Monitoring" section
  - Stream C: Adds "Runbooks" section

**Low/No Coordination Required**:
- All other files are stream-specific with no overlap

### Sequential Requirements

**Must happen in order**:
1. Stream B (monitoring) → Stream C (runbooks)
   - Runbooks reference alert names and thresholds from monitoring.md
   - Diagnosis steps use metrics defined in monitoring strategy

**Can happen in parallel**:
1. Stream A (deployment) || Stream B (monitoring)
   - Completely independent concerns
   - Different files, no cross-references during creation
   - Cross-linking happens at the end

### Cross-References (Post-Creation)

After all streams complete, add cross-links:
- deployment-guide.md → monitoring.md (health check metrics)
- monitoring.md → runbooks/ (link to incident response)
- runbooks → monitoring.md (alert thresholds)
- All docs → operations/README.md (index)

## Conflict Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: 95% of work has zero file conflicts

**Potential Conflicts**:
1. `docs/operations/README.md` - 3 streams update
   - **Mitigation**: Each stream creates distinct section, merge is straightforward
   - **Resolution**: Simple section append, no overlapping content

**No Conflicts**:
- All primary deliverables are in separate files
- No shared types, configs, or code
- Pure documentation work

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Hybrid (A || B, then C)

**Execution Plan**:

**Phase 1 - Parallel (0-3 hours)**:
- Launch Stream A (deployment) and Stream B (monitoring) simultaneously
- Both agents work independently on separate files
- Zero coordination required during this phase

**Phase 2 - Dependent (3-7 hours)**:
- Stream C (runbooks) starts when Stream B completes
- Uses monitoring strategy as reference
- Stream A may still be finishing deployment testing

**Phase 3 - Integration (7-8 hours)**:
- Merge updates to operations/README.md
- Add cross-links between documents
- Final review and validation

## Expected Timeline

**With Parallel Execution**:
- **Phase 1**: 0-3 hours (A & B running)
  - Stream A: deployment guide writing
  - Stream B: monitoring strategy (completes first)
- **Phase 2**: 3-7 hours (A finishing, C running)
  - Stream A: deployment testing in staging
  - Stream C: runbooks creation
- **Phase 3**: 7-8 hours (integration)
  - Cross-linking and review
- **Wall Time**: ~5 hours (with staging deployment testing)
- **Total Work**: 11 hours
- **Efficiency Gain**: 55% time savings

**Without Parallel Execution** (Sequential):
- Stream A: 0-4.5 hours
- Stream B: 4.5-7 hours
- Stream C: 7-11 hours
- **Wall Time**: 11 hours

**Parallelization Benefit**: 6 hours saved (11h → 5h wall time)

## Agent Assignments

**Stream A - devops-specialist**:
- Expertise: Deployment automation, Railway/AWS, CI/CD
- Focus: Making deployment guide actionable and testable
- Validates: Actual deployment in staging works

**Stream B - sre-specialist**:
- Expertise: Observability, metrics, alerting, SRE practices
- Focus: Production-grade monitoring strategy
- Validates: Metrics cover all critical paths

**Stream C - oncall-specialist**:
- Expertise: Incident response, troubleshooting, runbooks
- Focus: Copy-paste executable runbooks for 3AM incidents
- Validates: Runbooks are clear under pressure

## Work Distribution

| Stream | Hours | % of Total | Can Start | Depends On |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| A (Deployment) | 4.5 | 41% | Immediately | None |
| B (Monitoring) | 2.5 | 23% | Immediately | None |
| C (Runbooks) | 4.0 | 36% | After B | Stream B |
| **Total** | **11** | **100%** | - | - |

**Critical Path**: Stream A (4.5h) → Integration (1h) = 5.5 hours
**Parallel Savings**: 5.5 hours vs 11 hours sequential

## Quality Assurance

**Stream A (Deployment)**:
- [ ] Deployment guide tested in actual staging environment
- [ ] All commands copy-paste executable
- [ ] Rollback procedure verified
- [ ] Health checks return expected responses
- [ ] Migration workflow tested with sample migration

**Stream B (Monitoring)**:
- [ ] All RED metrics defined with implementation examples
- [ ] Alert thresholds aligned with SLO targets
- [ ] Logging format examples provided
- [ ] Distributed tracing covers critical paths
- [ ] Code examples are TypeScript-valid

**Stream C (Runbooks)**:
- [ ] Both runbooks follow standard template
- [ ] Symptoms, diagnosis, resolution, verification, escalation all present
- [ ] Commands are copy-paste executable
- [ ] References to monitoring.md are accurate
- [ ] Escalation paths clearly defined

**Integration**:
- [ ] operations/README.md has all 3 sections
- [ ] Cross-links between docs are bidirectional
- [ ] No broken internal links
- [ ] Consistent terminology across all docs

## Notes

**Why This Parallelization Works Well**:
1. **Natural Separation**: Deployment, monitoring, and runbooks are distinct operational concerns
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only Stream C depends on Stream B (for alert references)
3. **No Code Conflicts**: Pure documentation in separate files
4. **Expert Specialization**: Each stream benefits from specialized knowledge

**Risks & Mitigations**:
- **Risk**: operations/README.md merge conflicts
  - **Mitigation**: Each stream creates distinct section (## Deployment, ## Monitoring, ## Runbooks)
- **Risk**: Inconsistent terminology across streams
  - **Mitigation**: Final review pass for terminology alignment
- **Risk**: Stream C runbooks reference alerts not defined in Stream B
  - **Mitigation**: Stream C waits for Stream B completion

**Success Indicators**:
- [ ] Deployment guide enables staging deployment in <15 minutes (timed test)
- [ ] Monitoring strategy defines all critical metrics and alerts
- [ ] Runbooks are executable by engineer unfamiliar with system
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Peer review passes (DevOps engineer validates deployment, SRE validates monitoring)

**Quick Wins During Execution**:
- Stream A: Create deployment checklist (prevents common mistakes)
- Stream B: Provide Prometheus query examples (speeds adoption)
- Stream C: Include "common mistakes" section in runbooks

**Post-Task Actions**:
1. Schedule deployment practice session using guide
2. Configure actual alerts in staging environment
3. Run fire drill with runbooks (simulate ARCA outage)
4. Update architecture docs to reference operations docs
