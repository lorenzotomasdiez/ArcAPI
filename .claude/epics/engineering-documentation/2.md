# Task: Setup Documentation Infrastructure

## Description

Create the complete directory structure for the ARCA API documentation system and establish the foundational templates. This task sets up the skeleton that all other documentation tasks will populate.

Leverage the comprehensive structure already defined in the PRD (`.claude/prds/engineering-documentation.md`) and create:
- Complete `docs/` directory hierarchy
- Navigation hub (`docs/README.md`) with links to all sections
- Template files for each documentation category
- Placeholder files to guide future documentation efforts

This is the **critical foundation task** - all other documentation tasks depend on this structure existing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete `docs/` directory structure created matching PRD specification
- [ ] `docs/README.md` navigation hub exists with links to all major sections
- [ ] All subdirectories created (architecture/, specifications/, flows/, development/, operations/, security/)
- [ ] Placeholder/template files created for each documentation type with clear TODOs
- [ ] Directory structure validated (can navigate from README to any section in <3 clicks)
- [ ] `.gitkeep` files in empty directories to preserve structure in Git
- [ ] Structure documented in main project README (link to docs/)

## Technical Details

### Directory Structure to Create

```
docs/
├── README.md                          # Navigation hub (PRIORITY)
├── architecture/
│   ├── README.md                      # Architecture docs index
│   ├── 00-overview.md                 # Placeholder with TODO
│   ├── 01-system-context.md           # Placeholder with TODO
│   ├── 02-services.md                 # Placeholder with TODO
│   ├── 03-data-architecture.md        # Placeholder with TODO
│   ├── 04-infrastructure.md           # Placeholder with TODO
│   └── adrs/
│       ├── README.md                  # ADR index
│       └── .gitkeep
├── specifications/
│   ├── README.md                      # Specs index
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── README.md                  # How to use OpenAPI spec
│   │   └── .gitkeep                   # openapi.yaml will be added in Task 3
│   └── services/
│       ├── README.md                  # Service contracts index
│       └── .gitkeep
├── flows/
│   ├── README.md                      # Flows index
│   └── .gitkeep
├── development/
│   ├── README.md                      # Dev docs index
│   └── .gitkeep
├── operations/
│   ├── README.md                      # Ops docs index
│   └── runbooks/
│       ├── README.md                  # Runbooks index
│       └── .gitkeep
└── security/
    ├── README.md                      # Security docs index
    └── compliance/
        ├── README.md                  # Compliance docs index
        └── .gitkeep
```

### Implementation Approach

1. **Create directory structure** using `mkdir -p` for nested paths
2. **Write main `docs/README.md`** with navigation to all sections (most important file)
3. **Create section README files** with descriptions and links to subsections
4. **Add placeholder files** with clear TODOs and structure from PRD templates
5. **Test navigation** - verify every section is reachable from main README
6. **Update project root README** to link to documentation

### Key Considerations

- **Template Reuse**: Copy template structures from PRD into placeholder files
- **Clear TODOs**: Each placeholder should indicate what content is needed and which task will fill it
- **Mermaid Compatibility**: Ensure structure supports GitHub's Mermaid rendering
- **Discoverability**: Every document should be linked from a parent README
- **Future-Proof**: Structure should support 50+ services as project grows

### Files Affected

- Create: `docs/` directory and ~20 files
- Update: Project root `README.md` to add documentation link

## Dependencies

**No blocking dependencies** - this is the foundation task.

**Blocks:**
- Task 002 (needs directory structure)
- Task 003 (needs specifications/ directory)
- Task 004 (needs architecture/ directory)
- Task 005 (needs flows/ directory)
- Task 006 (needs development/ directory)
- Task 007 (needs operations/ directory)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: S
- **Hours**: 4 hours
- **Parallel**: false (must complete before others start)
- **Breakdown**:
  - Directory creation: 30 min
  - Main README with navigation: 1 hour
  - Section READMEs and placeholders: 2 hours
  - Testing navigation and validation: 30 min

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All directories created and match PRD structure
- [ ] Main `docs/README.md` has complete navigation with descriptions
- [ ] Every section has a README file explaining its purpose
- [ ] Placeholder files contain clear TODOs indicating which task will complete them
- [ ] Navigation tested - can reach any section from main README in <3 clicks
- [ ] Structure validated by walking through all links
- [ ] Project README updated with link to documentation
- [ ] Changes committed to Git (directory structure preserved with .gitkeep files)
- [ ] README renders correctly in GitHub (verify Mermaid if any diagrams added)

## Notes

**Why this is critical:**
- All other tasks build on this foundation
- Establishes documentation discoverability from day one
- Prevents documentation sprawl (ad-hoc file creation)
- Demonstrates organizational maturity to stakeholders

**Quick Win:**
- Even with just structure and READMEs, team can understand what documentation will exist
- Creates forcing function for comprehensive documentation (empty sections are obvious)

**Reference:**
- PRD section: "Documentation Structure" (lines 69-110 in epic.md)
- PRD Appendix: "Directory Structure" (complete specification)
