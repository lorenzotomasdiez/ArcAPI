# Execution Status: engineering-documentation Epic

## Active Agents
- None (ready to launch parallel tasks #4, #5, #6, #7, #8)

## Ready Issues - PARALLEL EXECUTION AVAILABLE
- Issue #4: Create OpenAPI specification (dependency #2, #3 completed)
- Issue #5: Document service architecture (dependency #2, #3 completed) ← Can run in parallel
- Issue #6: Create critical flow diagrams (dependency #2, #3 completed) ← Can run in parallel
- Issue #7: Write development guides (dependency #2, #3 completed) ← Can run in parallel
- Issue #8: Create operational documentation (dependency #2, #3 completed) ← Can run in parallel

## Blocked Issues
- Issue #9: Setup CI/CD documentation validation (depends on #4)

## Completed
- ✅ Issue #2: Setup Documentation Infrastructure (Completed 2025-10-15T04:45:00Z)
  - 25 files created
  - Complete documentation structure established
  - All acceptance criteria met

- ✅ Issue #3: Write Core Architecture Documents (Completed 2025-10-15T05:15:00Z)
  - Stream A: Architecture overview + System context diagram (3 hours)
  - Stream B: 3 ADRs completed (database, authentication, deployment) (5 hours)
  - Total: 5 documents created with quantified quality attributes
  - Mermaid C4 diagram renders correctly
  - Ready for Google Engineering review

## Dependency Graph
