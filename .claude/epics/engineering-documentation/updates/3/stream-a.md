# Stream A Progress: Core Architecture Documents

## 2025-10-15 15:30 - IN PROGRESS

### Completed
- Architecture overview document (00-overview.md) created with comprehensive content:
  - Executive summary with value proposition
  - Business and technical objectives
  - Quantified quality attributes (99.95% uptime, P95 <200ms, 100K invoices/day)
  - Detailed architectural approach (microservices, API-first, event-driven, cloud-native)
  - Technology philosophy (managed services first, tech-agnostic, open source preference)
  - Risk mitigation strategies

- System context diagram (01-system-context.md) created with:
  - Complete C4 Level 1 Mermaid diagram showing 8 services:
    - 3 actors: API Consumer (Developer), End User (Business Owner), Platform Admin
    - 1 main system: ARCA API Platform
    - 5 external systems: ARCA/AFIP, OpenAI, Stripe, Resend, Cloudflare
  - Detailed description of each external actor (demographics, interactions, use cases)
  - Comprehensive external system documentation (SLAs, interaction patterns, costs, mitigation)
  - System boundaries clearly defined
  - Data flow descriptions at system boundary
  - Quality attributes at system level
  - External dependency SLA table

### Next Steps
1. Test Mermaid diagram rendering (verify on mermaid.live or GitHub preview)
2. Update architecture README.md to reflect new active status
3. Commit changes with proper format
4. Signal completion for Stream B

### Files Created/Updated
- `/Users/lorenzo-personal/projects/afip/docs/architecture/00-overview.md` - ACTIVE (replaced placeholder)

### Quality Metrics
- Architecture Overview: ~380 lines, covers all required sections
- System Context: ~477 lines, comprehensive external system documentation
- Quality attributes quantified: ✓
  - Availability: 99.95% uptime (21.6 min downtime/month)
  - Performance: P95 latency <200ms (excluding ARCA)
  - Scalability: 100K invoices/day
  - Security: ISO 27001, GDPR compliant
  - Cost: <$0.02 per invoice
- External dependencies mapped: ✓ (ARCA, OpenAI, Stripe, Resend, Cloudflare)
- Mermaid diagram created: ✓ (C4 Level 1 with 3 actors + 5 external systems)

### Coordination Notes
- Stream B can begin cross-referencing once this update is marked COMPLETE
- No file conflicts (Stream A works on 00-overview.md, 01-system-context.md, README.md)
- Stream B works on ADRs (separate files)
