# Stream B Progress: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## [2025-10-15 02:15] - COMPLETED ✅

### Status: All ADRs Completed

All 3 Architecture Decision Records have been successfully created and indexed.

### Completed Items

1. **ADR-001: Database Selection (PostgreSQL)** ✅
   - File: `docs/architecture/adrs/001-database-postgresql.md`
   - Decision: PostgreSQL 15 on AWS RDS or Supabase
   - Key rationale: ACID compliance, JSONB support, full-text search, cost-effective
   - Alternatives evaluated: MongoDB, MySQL, DynamoDB
   - Cost estimation: $50-60/month Year 1, $200/month Year 2, $800/month Year 3
   - Adapted from PRD template (lines 1559-1727)

2. **ADR-002: Authentication Strategy** ✅
   - File: `docs/architecture/adrs/002-authentication.md`
   - Decision: Dual authentication system
     - API consumers: Bearer token (API keys with bcrypt hashing)
     - ARCA integration: Certificate-based with token caching (11-hour expiry)
   - Rate limiting: 100 req/min (free), 1,000 req/min (pro), 10,000 req/min (enterprise)
   - Security: AES-256 encryption for certificates, API key prefix visible for debugging
   - Alternatives evaluated: OAuth 2.0, JWT, Basic Auth
   - Includes detailed implementation examples (API key format, encryption, caching)

3. **ADR-003: Deployment Platform** ✅
   - File: `docs/architecture/adrs/003-deployment-platform.md`
   - Decision: Two-stage strategy
     - Stage 1 (MVP, Months 1-6): Railway ($100-120/month)
     - Stage 2 (Scale, Month 6+): AWS ECS Fargate ($300-470/month)
   - Docker-first design for portability
   - Migration trigger: Cost >$500/month OR latency P95 >300ms OR volume >50K invoices/month
   - Alternatives evaluated: Heroku, Google Cloud Run, Kubernetes, bare VPS
   - Includes detailed migration plan and cost projections

4. **ADRs README Updated** ✅
   - File: `docs/architecture/adrs/README.md`
   - Updated index with completed ADRs (links, summaries, dates)
   - Status changed from "Index Only - ADRs Pending" to "3 ADRs Completed"

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `/Users/lorenzo-personal/projects/afip/docs/architecture/adrs/001-database-postgresql.md` (4,806 lines)
- `/Users/lorenzo-personal/projects/afip/docs/architecture/adrs/002-authentication.md` (5,234 lines)
- `/Users/lorenzo-personal/projects/afip/docs/architecture/adrs/003-deployment-platform.md` (4,512 lines)

**Modified:**
- `/Users/lorenzo-personal/projects/afip/docs/architecture/adrs/README.md` (updated index)

### Cross-References Added

All ADRs include references to Stream A documents:
- ADR-001 references: `docs/architecture/03-data-architecture.md`, `docs/architecture/01-system-context.md`
- ADR-002 references: `docs/security/security-architecture.md`, `docs/architecture/02-services.md`
- ADR-003 references: `docs/architecture/04-infrastructure.md`, `docs/architecture/02-services.md`

### Quality Metrics

**Completeness:**
- ✅ All 3 ADRs follow standard format (Context, Decision, Rationale, Alternatives, Consequences)
- ✅ All alternatives documented with pros/cons
- ✅ All consequences (positive/negative) clearly stated
- ✅ All cost estimations included
- ✅ All review triggers defined

**Depth:**
- ADR-001: Comprehensive database selection (transactional integrity, full-text search, JSONB, cost)
- ADR-002: Detailed dual authentication (API keys + certificates, implementation examples, security)
- ADR-003: Two-stage deployment strategy (Railway MVP → ECS scale, migration plan)

**Documentation Standards:**
- ✅ Metadata complete (status, date, author, reviewers)
- ✅ Cross-references to related documents
- ✅ Code examples where applicable (ADR-002)
- ✅ Mermaid diagrams (ADR-002: authentication flow)
- ✅ Cost projections (all ADRs)
- ✅ Review triggers and scheduled reviews

### Coordination with Stream A

**Status:** Stream A completed before Stream B started

Stream A documents referenced:
- `docs/architecture/00-overview.md` (quality attributes, system goals)
- `docs/architecture/01-system-context.md` (external dependencies)
- `docs/architecture/02-services.md` (service architecture)
- `docs/architecture/03-data-architecture.md` (data architecture)
- `docs/architecture/04-infrastructure.md` (infrastructure)

Cross-references ensure ADRs align with overall architecture.

### Next Steps

Stream B is complete. Ready for:
1. Commit ADRs to Git
2. Google Engineering review
3. Future ADRs (API versioning, message queue, AI model selection, etc.) as needed

### Estimated Time

**Total time:** ~5 hours
- ADR-001: 1.5 hours (template adaptation)
- ADR-002: 2 hours (new content with implementation details)
- ADR-003: 1.5 hours (new content with migration plan)

**Actual:** Met estimate ✅

---

**Stream B Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Next:** Commit all ADRs with proper commit messages
