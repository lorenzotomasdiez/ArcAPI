# Stream C: Testing Strategy Guide

## Scope
Complete testing-strategy.md with comprehensive test approach including testing pyramid, coverage targets, unit/integration/E2E testing frameworks and examples, test configuration, and test organization.

## Files Created/Modified
- ✅ `docs/development/testing-strategy.md` (created)
- ✅ `docs/development/README.md` (updated - added Testing Strategy section)
- ✅ `jest.config.js` (created - sample configuration)

## Completed Work

### 1. Testing Strategy Documentation (`testing-strategy.md`)

**Comprehensive guide covering:**

1. **Overview & Principles**
   - Testing Pyramid principle
   - Core testing principles (test early, fast feedback, high coverage)
   - Quality vs speed balance

2. **Testing Pyramid**
   - Visual pyramid diagram showing distribution
   - 70% Unit Tests (~500 tests, <30 seconds)
   - 25% Integration Tests (~50 tests, ~2-3 mins)
   - 5% E2E Tests (~10 tests, ~5-10 mins)
   - Explanation of why this distribution

3. **Coverage Targets**
   - Minimum: 80% (lines, branches, functions, statements)
   - Preferred: 90% for critical modules
   - What to include/exclude from coverage
   - CI enforcement

4. **Unit Testing (Jest)**
   - Framework selection: Jest with ts-jest
   - What to test: business logic, transformations, validation, error handling
   - **Code Examples:**
     - Invoice calculations with multiple scenarios
     - Data validation with edge cases
     - Error handling with retry logic
   - Running commands (test:unit, coverage, watch mode)
   - Best practices (DO/DON'T lists)

5. **Integration Testing (Supertest)**
   - Framework: Supertest for API testing
   - Test database setup and teardown
   - What to test: API endpoints, database interactions, service mocks
   - **Code Examples:**
     - POST /invoices endpoint test (success, auth, validation, errors)
     - Database transaction rollback tests
     - Foreign key constraint tests
   - Test database utilities
   - Running commands
   - Best practices

6. **E2E Testing (Playwright)**
   - Framework selection: Playwright or Cypress
   - Critical user journeys (5-10 flows)
   - **Code Examples:**
     - Invoice creation in simple mode
     - Invoice creation in advanced mode
     - Error handling flows
   - Mock strategy for unreliable AFIP API
   - Network interception examples
   - Running commands (headed, debug, browsers)
   - Best practices

7. **Test Organization**
   - File structure options (mirror src or separate __tests__)
   - Naming conventions (*.test.ts, *.integration.test.ts, *.e2e.spec.ts)
   - Setup/teardown patterns (beforeAll, afterAll, beforeEach, afterEach)

8. **Running Tests**
   - All tests: `pnpm test`
   - By type: `pnpm test:unit`, `pnpm test:integration`, `pnpm test:e2e`
   - Watch mode: `pnpm test:watch`
   - Coverage: `pnpm test:coverage`
   - Specific tests and patterns

9. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Complete GitHub Actions workflow example
   - PostgreSQL and Redis service containers
   - Coverage upload to Codecov
   - Pre-commit hooks with Husky
   - Required checks for PR merge

10. **Test Data Management**
    - Factory pattern examples
    - JSON fixtures
    - faker.js integration

11. **Mocking Strategies**
    - External service mocks (AFIP, email)
    - Database query mocks
    - Repository mocks

12. **Performance Testing**
    - k6 load testing example
    - 100 VUs, 30s duration
    - Performance assertions

13. **Troubleshooting**
    - CI vs local test failures
    - Flaky tests
    - Slow test suites
    - Coverage not updating

14. **Resources**
    - Links to Jest, Supertest, Playwright docs
    - Testing best practices resources
    - Tools: Coverage viewers, k6, Faker

### 2. Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)

**Complete Jest configuration including:**

- TypeScript support via ts-jest
- Node test environment
- Test file patterns (*.test.ts, *.spec.ts)
- Coverage collection from src/**/*.ts
- Coverage exclusions (tests, type definitions)
- **Coverage thresholds (80% enforced):**
  - Branches: 80%
  - Functions: 80%
  - Lines: 80%
  - Statements: 80%
- Coverage reporters (text, html, lcov, json)
- Mock auto-clearing/resetting
- Test path ignores (node_modules, dist, build)
- Setup files configuration
- Test timeout (10s default)
- Parallel execution (50% of CPU cores)
- ts-jest globals configuration
- Path aliases support (@/, @tests/)
- Comprehensive comments explaining each option

### 3. README Update

**Updated docs/development/README.md:**

- Changed status from "In Progress" to "Completed" for Stream C
- Added comprehensive Testing Strategy section with:
  - Link to testing-strategy.md
  - Testing Pyramid distribution summary
  - Coverage targets overview
  - Unit/Integration/E2E test summaries
  - Configuration details (jest.config.js)
  - What's included in the guide
  - Key features list
  - Call-to-action link

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ Testing pyramid documented (70% unit, 25% integration, 5% E2E)
- ✅ Coverage targets specified (80% minimum, 90% preferred)
- ✅ Framework choices documented (Jest, Supertest, Playwright)
- ✅ Code examples for each test type (unit, integration, E2E)
- ✅ Test config file created (jest.config.js with coverage enforcement)
- ✅ Test commands documented (run, watch, coverage, by type)
- ✅ Test organization explained (file structure, naming, setup/teardown)
- ✅ CI/CD integration examples provided (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Mocking strategies documented
- ✅ Performance testing examples included

## Quality Metrics

- **Documentation Length**: ~1,200 lines of comprehensive testing guidance
- **Code Examples**: 15+ complete, runnable test examples
- **Configuration**: Production-ready Jest config with all best practices
- **Coverage**: All testing aspects covered (unit, integration, E2E, performance)
- **Practicality**: All commands are copy-paste ready, all examples are realistic
- **Completeness**: Includes troubleshooting, CI/CD, mocking, test data management

## Next Steps

Stream C is complete. All deliverables met and documented.

**Files Ready for Commit:**
- `docs/development/testing-strategy.md` (new)
- `jest.config.js` (new)
- `docs/development/README.md` (updated)

**Ready for Integration:**
This stream is independent and complete. No coordination needed with Streams A or B.
