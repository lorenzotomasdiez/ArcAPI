# Stream B: GitHub Actions Workflow

## Scope
Build the complete GitHub Actions workflow file for documentation validation.

## Files
- `.github/workflows/docs-validation.yml`

## Progress
- Created `.github/workflows/` directory structure
- Created complete GitHub Actions workflow file with all 6 validation checks:
  1. Validate OpenAPI Specification (with skip if not found)
  2. Check for Broken Links with markdown-link-check
  3. Validate Mermaid Diagrams (check for ```mermaid blocks)
  4. Spell Check with cspell
  5. Require Docs Updates for Code Changes
  6. Lint Markdown Files with markdownlint-cli2-action
- Added validation summary step
- Workflow configured to trigger on pull_request for docs/**, src/**, and workflow file changes
- Uses ubuntu-latest runner with Node.js 20 and npm caching
- All validation steps use `if: always()` for fail-fast behavior
- Ready for commit
