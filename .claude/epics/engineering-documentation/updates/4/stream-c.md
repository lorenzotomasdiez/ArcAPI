# Stream C: API Key Management & Documentation

## Scope
Document API key management endpoints and create supporting documentation (README for spec usage, validation commands).

## Files Modified
- `docs/specifications/api/openapi.yaml` (added api-keys endpoints and schemas)
- `docs/specifications/api/README.md` (updated with comprehensive usage guide)
- `docs/specifications/README.md` (updated with API spec link)

## Completed Work

### OpenAPI Spec Changes (openapi.yaml)
1. Added ApiKeys tag for endpoint organization
2. Added POST /api-keys endpoint:
   - Create API key with tier selection (free/pro)
   - Full key returned only at creation time with warning
   - Security best practices documented
   - Rate limiting per tier documented
3. Added GET /api-keys endpoint:
   - List keys with pagination support
   - Prefix-only display for security
   - Show last_used_at to identify unused keys
4. Added DELETE /api-keys/{id} endpoint:
   - Immediate key revocation
   - Best practices for when to revoke
5. Added ApiKey schema:
   - Fields: id, name, prefix, tier, last_used_at, created_at
   - Comprehensive documentation on key format (arc_live_/arc_test_)
   - Security notes about hashing and prefix display
   - Rate limiting documentation (free: 100 req/min, pro: 1000 req/min)
6. Added ApiKeyCreateRequest schema:
   - Fields: name (required), tier (optional, defaults to free)

### Documentation Updates

#### docs/specifications/api/README.md
- Added comprehensive "Using the Specification" section:
  - Validation (Spectral commands and what it checks)
  - Documentation Generation (Redocly, Swagger UI)
  - Development Usage:
    - TypeScript type generation
    - Client SDK generation (Python, JS, PHP, etc.)
    - Mock server setup with Prism
    - Contract testing (Dredd, Schemathesis)
    - Server stub generation for multiple languages
  - References section (OpenAPI spec, RFC 7807, tools)
- Updated status to "Active"

#### docs/specifications/README.md
- Added direct link to openapi.yaml file
- Updated status to "In Progress - Task #4"

## Commits
1. `c995f24` - Issue #4 Stream C: Add API key management endpoints to OpenAPI spec
2. `b7f6430` - Issue #4 Stream C: Add API specification usage guide and update index

## Validation
- Followed same pattern as Stream A (error responses, tagging, examples)
- All endpoints have operationId, tags, descriptions, examples
- Schemas include comprehensive field documentation
- Rate limiting documented in descriptions
- Security best practices included
- Did not run Spectral validation (deferred to Stream D)

## Notes
- API keys use prefix display for security (only first 8 chars after environment prefix shown)
- Full key only shown at creation time
- Rate limits documented: free (100 req/min), pro (1000 req/min)
- Key format: arc_live_* for production, arc_test_* for sandbox
- Keys stored hashed (bcrypt) with only prefix in plaintext
