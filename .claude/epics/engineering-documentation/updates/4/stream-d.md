# Stream D: Validation & Quality Assurance

## Scope
Validate complete OpenAPI specification with Spectral, verify examples match schemas, ensure naming consistency, and generate HTML documentation preview.

## Files
- `docs/specifications/api/openapi.yaml` (validated & fixed)
- `docs/specifications/api/openapi.html` (generated preview)
- `.spectral.yaml` (validation configuration)

## Work Completed

### 1. Spectral CLI Setup
- Created `.spectral.yaml` configuration file with OAS rules
- Installed and configured Spectral CLI for OpenAPI validation

### 2. Initial Validation
Ran Spectral validation and found 7 errors:
1. Parser error on line 1102: YAML syntax issue with description field
2. Invalid `documento_tipo` type in 5 examples (should be integer, was string)
3. Missing `fecha_emision` field in 202 response example
4. Missing `items` field in GET /invoices list response
5. Incomplete examples missing required fields

### 3. Errors Fixed
All validation errors resolved:

**Parser Error (Line 1102)**
- Fixed YAML syntax error in `numero_completo` description
- Changed "formato:" to quoted "format:" to avoid YAML key confusion

**Schema Type Errors**
- Fixed `documento_tipo` in all Invoice response examples (changed from string "CUIT" to integer 80)
- Removed `allOf` override in Invoice.cliente schema that was causing type conflicts
- Updated all examples to use integer codes (80 for CUIT) instead of human-readable strings

**Missing Required Fields**
- Added complete Invoice fields to POST /invoices 202 response example
- Added `items` array to GET /invoices list response examples
- Added all required fields to PATCH /invoices response example
- Ensured all Cliente objects include required fields: documento_tipo, documento_numero, razon_social, condicion_iva

**Documento Number Format**
- Standardized all documento_numero values to remove dashes (e.g., "20123456789" instead of "20-12345678-9")
- Matches the Cliente schema pattern: `^\d{11}$|^\d{8}$`

### 4. Final Validation Results
**Status: ZERO ERRORS**

```bash
npx @stoplight/spectral-cli lint docs/specifications/api/openapi.yaml
# Result: No results with a severity of 'error' found!
```

All validation checks passed:
- All operations have unique `operationId`
- All operations have tags
- All operations have descriptions
- All examples match their schemas
- No undefined schemas or circular references
- No orphaned components
- Consistent naming conventions (snake_case for fields)

### 5. Naming Consistency Check
**Result: PASS**

The spec consistently uses:
- **snake_case** for all JSON field names (documento_tipo, fecha_emision, etc.)
- **camelCase** for operationIds (createInvoice, listInvoices, etc.)
- **PascalCase** for schema names (Invoice, Cliente, InvoiceItem, etc.)

This is consistent throughout the specification.

### 6. HTML Documentation Preview
Successfully generated HTML documentation:
- File: `docs/specifications/api/openapi.html` (249 KiB)
- Tool: Redocly CLI
- All sections render correctly
- Interactive API reference with request/response examples
- Properly formatted descriptions and code samples

### 7. MVP Endpoints Verification
**Documented Endpoints:**
- POST /invoices - Create invoice (Simple & Advanced modes)
- GET /invoices - List invoices with pagination and filters
- GET /invoices/{id} - Get invoice by ID
- PATCH /invoices/{id} - Update invoice
- POST /api-keys - Create API key
- GET /api-keys - List API keys
- DELETE /api-keys/{id} - Revoke API key

**Missing Endpoints (Not in Scope for Stream D):**
- POST /certificates
- GET /certificates
- DELETE /certificates/{id}
- GET /reference-data/invoice-types
- GET /reference-data/iva-rates
- GET /reference-data/document-types
- GET /reference-data/currencies
- GET /reference-data/sales-points

**Note:** The spec references `/reference-data/invoice-types` and `/reference-data/document-types` in descriptions but these endpoints are not defined. These should be added by the responsible stream (B or C).

## Validation Summary

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Spectral Validation | PASS | 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| Schema Consistency | PASS | All examples match schemas |
| Naming Convention | PASS | Consistent snake_case/camelCase |
| Required Fields | PASS | All examples complete |
| HTML Documentation | PASS | 249 KiB generated successfully |
| MVP Endpoints | PARTIAL | Invoices & API Keys documented, Certificates & Reference Data missing |

## Files Modified
- `/docs/specifications/api/openapi.yaml` - Fixed 7 validation errors
- `/.spectral.yaml` - Created validation configuration
- `/docs/specifications/api/openapi.html` - Generated documentation preview

## Next Steps
- Streams B/C should add missing Certificates and Reference Data endpoints
- Consider adding integration tests that validate against this spec
- Set up CI pipeline to run Spectral validation on every commit
