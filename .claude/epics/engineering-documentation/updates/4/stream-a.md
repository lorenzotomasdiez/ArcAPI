# Stream A: Core Infrastructure & Invoice Endpoints

## Scope
Set up OpenAPI 3.1 base structure, authentication, error schemas, and complete invoice endpoints documentation (POST, GET, PATCH with simple/advanced modes).

## Files
- `docs/specifications/api/openapi.yaml` (created - 1208 lines)

## Progress
- ✅ Created OpenAPI 3.1 specification with complete base structure
- ✅ Defined info section with authentication, rate limiting, and error format documentation
- ✅ Configured servers: production (api.arcaapi.com) and sandbox (sandbox.arcaapi.com)
- ✅ Implemented BearerAuth security scheme
- ✅ Created RFC 7807 ProblemDetails error schema
- ✅ Defined reusable error responses: BadRequest (400), Unauthorized (401), RateLimited (429), InternalError (500)
- ✅ Documented invoice endpoints:
  - POST /invoices (simple + advanced modes)
  - GET /invoices (with pagination and filters)
  - GET /invoices/{id}
  - PATCH /invoices/{id}
- ✅ Created comprehensive request schemas:
  - SimpleInvoiceRequest (AI-powered natural language)
  - AdvancedInvoiceRequest (full structured control)
  - InvoiceUpdateRequest (partial updates)
- ✅ Created nested schemas:
  - Cliente (customer information)
  - InvoiceItem (line items with IVA)
  - Tributo (additional taxes)
- ✅ Created Invoice response schema with complete field set
- ✅ Added comprehensive examples for all requests and responses
- ✅ Included detailed field descriptions, validation rules, and enum values
- ✅ Documented invoice lifecycle, processing flow, and performance targets

## Deliverables
- OpenAPI 3.1 specification ready for:
  - Frontend mock API development
  - Backend implementation
  - SDK generation
  - API documentation rendering
  - Contract testing

## Notes
- Specification is complete and committed
- Validation with Spectral will be handled by Stream D
- All invoice endpoints documented according to product PRD requirements
- Error responses follow RFC 7807 standard consistently
- Rate limiting and authentication documented in detail
