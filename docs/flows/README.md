# Flow Documentation

Visual documentation of user flows, system flows, and data flows using Mermaid diagrams. This section helps engineers understand how the system works through visual representations.

## Overview

Flow documentation provides:
- **User Flows**: How end users interact with the system
- **System Flows**: How services interact internally
- **Data Flows**: How data moves through the system
- **Deployment Flows**: How code gets to production

All diagrams use Mermaid format for version control and GitHub rendering.

## Status

> **Status**: TODO - Pending completion in Task #5

> Flow diagrams will be created in **Task #5: Document System Flows** (Week 2-3)

   - Quality gates
   - Approval steps

2. **Database Migration Flow**
   - Schema change process
   - Rollback capability
   - Zero-downtime deployment

3. **Feature Flag Rollout**
   - Gradual rollout process
   - A/B testing
   - Rollback procedure

4. **Rollback Procedure**
   - Incident detection
   - Decision process
   - Rollback execution
   - Verification

## Flow Documentation Standards

### Diagram Format

All diagrams use Mermaid and include:

```markdown
## Flow Name

### Overview
[1-2 sentence description]

### Actors
- Actor 1: Description
- Actor 2: Description

### Preconditions
- Condition 1
- Condition 2

### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
[Mermaid diagram code]
```

### Step-by-Step

#### 1. Step Name (Timing)
[Detailed description]
- Success path
- Failure scenarios

[Continue for each step...]

### Success Criteria
[What defines success]

### Error Handling
[Table of errors and handling]

### Performance Targets
[Latency expectations]

### Monitoring
[What to monitor]
```

### Diagram Types

**Sequence Diagrams** (most common):
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant Database

    User->>API: Request
    API->>Database: Query
    Database-->>API: Result
    API-->>User: Response
```

**Flowcharts** (for decision logic):
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Check Auth}
    B -->|Valid| C[Process]
    B -->|Invalid| D[Return 401]
    C --> E[Return 200]
```

**State Diagrams** (for state machines):
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending
    Pending --> Processing
    Processing --> Approved
    Processing --> Failed
    Approved --> [*]
    Failed --> [*]
```

## Example Flow

> **Example**: Invoice Creation (Simple Mode)
>
> See PRD Appendix for complete example:
> - Location: `.claude/prds/engineering-documentation.md` lines 1246-1406
> - Includes: Overview, actors, preconditions, detailed diagram, step-by-step, error handling, performance targets

Key elements:
- Sequence diagram showing all actors
- Step-by-step breakdown with timings
- Error handling table
- Performance targets
- Monitoring recommendations

## Performance Expectations

Document performance for each flow:

- **Total Latency**: P50, P95, P99
- **Breakdown**: Per component/step
- **Bottlenecks**: Known slow components
- **Optimization**: Plans to improve

Example:
```
Invoice Creation Flow:
- Total: P50 2s, P95 4s, P99 6s
- Breakdown:
  - Auth + validation: 100ms
  - AI generation: 1s (P50), 2s (P95)
  - ARCA call: 1s (P50), 2s (P95)
  - Other: 100ms
```

## Error Scenarios

Document all error paths:

| Error | Status Code | Retry? | User Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Invalid API key | 401 | No | Check API key |
| Rate limited | 429 | Yes | Wait or upgrade |
| Validation error | 400 | No | Fix request |
| Service down | 503 | Yes | Retry later |

## Using Flow Documentation

### For New Engineers

1. Start with user flows to understand product
2. Review system flows to understand implementation
3. Study error handling for each flow
4. Review performance expectations

### For Debugging

1. Identify which flow is failing
2. Follow step-by-step to locate failure point
3. Check error handling table for resolution
4. Review monitoring section for observability

### For Architecture Review

1. Evaluate flow complexity
2. Identify potential bottlenecks
3. Review error handling coverage
4. Assess scalability of design
