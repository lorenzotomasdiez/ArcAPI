### 2. Monitoring & Observability (TODO - Task #7)

**File**: `monitoring.md`

Comprehensive monitoring strategy:

**Metrics to Collect:**
- **RED Method** (Rate, Errors, Duration):
  - Request rate (requests/minute)
  - Error rate (% errors)
  - Duration (P50, P95, P99 latency)
- **USE Method** (Utilization, Saturation, Errors):
  - CPU/memory utilization
  - Queue depth
  - Error counts

**Per-Service Metrics:**
- API: Request rate, latency, error rate
- Database: Connection pool, query latency, slow queries
- Redis: Hit rate, memory usage, evictions
- ARCA Client: Call latency, error rate, token cache hit rate

**Logging Strategy:**
- Structured JSON logging
- Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Centralized logging (ELK/CloudWatch)
- Retention: 90 days operational, 1 year audit

**Distributed Tracing:**
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- Trace all service-to-service calls
- Visualize with Jaeger or CloudWatch X-Ray

**Dashboards:**
- System overview dashboard
- Service-specific dashboards
- Database performance dashboard
- Business metrics dashboard

**Alerting:**
- Alert definitions and thresholds
- Escalation procedures
- On-call rotation
- PagerDuty/Opsgenie integration

### 3. Incident Response (TODO - Task #7)

**File**: `incident-response.md`

Incident management procedures:

**Severity Levels:**
- **SEV1 (Critical)**: Complete outage, data loss
  - Response time: 15 minutes
  - Page on-call immediately
- **SEV2 (High)**: Partial outage, degraded performance
  - Response time: 30 minutes
  - Notify on-call
- **SEV3 (Medium)**: Minor issue, workaround available
  - Response time: 4 hours
  - Track in backlog
- **SEV4 (Low)**: Cosmetic, no impact
  - Response time: 1 week
  - Fix in next sprint

**Incident Response Process:**
1. Detection and alerting
2. Acknowledge and assess severity
3. Assemble response team
4. Investigate and diagnose
5. Implement fix or workaround
6. Verify resolution
7. Post-mortem (SEV1-SEV2)

**Communication:**
- Internal: Slack incident channel
- External: Status page updates
- Stakeholders: Executive notification

**Post-Mortem Template:**
- What happened?
- What was the impact?
- What was the root cause?
- What actions will prevent recurrence?
- Timeline of events

### 4. Runbooks (TODO - Task #7)

**Directory**: `runbooks/`

Step-by-step procedures for common operational issues. See [Runbooks README](./runbooks/README.md).

Planned runbooks:
- ARCA API down or unresponsive
- Database connection pool exhausted
- Redis out of memory
- High API latency
- Certificate expiration
- Deployment rollback
- Database migration failure
- Service container crashes
- Rate limit exceeded
- Memory leak investigation

### 5. Disaster Recovery (TODO - Task #7)

**File**: `disaster-recovery.md`

Business continuity and disaster recovery:

**Recovery Objectives:**
- **RTO** (Recovery Time Objective): <1 hour
- **RPO** (Recovery Point Objective): <5 minutes

**Backup Procedures:**
- Database: Automated daily snapshots
- Files: S3 versioning and cross-region replication
- Configuration: Git-based (IaC)
- Secrets: Replicated in secrets manager

**Failover Procedures:**
- Primary region failure â†’ Secondary region
- Database failover (manual/automatic)
- DNS failover (Route53 health checks)
- Verification steps

**Recovery Testing:**
- Quarterly DR drills
- Restore from backup test
- Cross-region failover test
- Document test results

### 6. Performance Optimization (TODO - Task #7)

**File**: `performance-optimization.md`

Performance tuning guide:

- Database query optimization
- Index analysis and creation
- Redis caching strategies
- Connection pooling tuning
- API response time optimization
- Load testing and capacity planning

## Monitoring Tools

### Planned Tooling

- **Metrics**: Prometheus or CloudWatch
- **Dashboards**: Grafana or CloudWatch Dashboards
- **Logging**: ELK Stack or CloudWatch Logs
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry + Jaeger/X-Ray
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty or Opsgenie
- **Status Page**: Statuspage.io or custom
- **APM**: Datadog or New Relic (optional)

### Key Dashboards

1. **System Overview**
   - Total request rate
   - Error rate
   - P95 latency
   - Active users
   - Invoice creation rate

2. **API Service**
   - Endpoint performance
   - Error breakdown
   - Rate limiting metrics
   - Authentication success rate

3. **Database**
   - Connection pool usage
   - Query latency (P50, P95, P99)
   - Slow query log
   - Replication lag

4. **Infrastructure**
   - CPU/memory utilization
   - Network I/O
   - Disk usage
   - Container health

## SLO/SLI Definitions

**Service Level Objectives:**

| Service | SLI | Target | Measurement |
|---------|-----|--------|-------------|
| API | Availability | 99.95% | Uptime monitoring |
| API | Latency (P95) | <200ms | Response time |
| API | Error Rate | <0.1% | 4xx/5xx responses |
| Database | Query Latency (P95) | <50ms | Query timing |
| ARCA Integration | Success Rate | >99% | Successful CAE |

**Error Budget:**
- 99.95% uptime = 4.38 hours downtime/year
- Monthly budget: 21.6 minutes
- Alerts when 50% consumed

## On-Call Responsibilities

**On-Call Engineer:**
- Monitor alerts and respond
- Triage incidents and escalate if needed
- Follow runbooks for resolution
- Document all incidents
- Participate in post-mortems

**On-Call Rotation:**
- 1-week rotations
- Primary + secondary on-call
- Handoff meeting at rotation change
- Escalation to tech lead if needed

**On-Call Compensation:**
- Paid on-call stipend
- Time-off-in-lieu for incident response
