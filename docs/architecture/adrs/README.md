# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Architecture Decision Records document significant architectural decisions made during the development of ARCA API, including context, decision, consequences, and alternatives considered.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help:

- Preserve architectural knowledge over time
- Onboard new team members quickly
- Understand rationale behind past decisions
- Avoid revisiting settled decisions
- Document trade-offs and alternatives

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Author**: [Name]
**Reviewers**: [Names]

## Context
[What is the issue we're facing? What factors are at play?]

## Decision
[What decision did we make?]

## Rationale
[Why did we choose this option? What are the benefits?]

## Alternatives Considered
[What other options did we evaluate? Why were they rejected?]

## Consequences
[What are the positive and negative consequences?]

## Compliance & Security
[Any compliance or security implications?]

## Cost Estimation
[Financial impact of this decision?]

## Review & Revisit
[When should we review this decision?]
```

## ADR Index

> **Status**: TODO - ADRs will be created in Tasks #3-4
>
> The following ADRs will be documented as architectural decisions are made:

### Planned ADRs

1. **ADR-001: Database Selection** (Task #3, Week 1)
   - PostgreSQL vs MySQL vs MongoDB vs DynamoDB
   - Decision: PostgreSQL 15+
   - Rationale: ACID compliance, JSONB support, full-text search

2. **ADR-002: Authentication Strategy** (Task #3, Week 1)
   - API key vs OAuth2 vs JWT
   - Decision: JWT-based API keys
   - Rationale: Stateless, scalable, secure

3. **ADR-003: Deployment Platform** (Task #3, Week 1)
   - AWS vs GCP vs Azure vs Vercel
   - Decision: TBD based on team expertise
   - Considerations: Cost, managed services, DevOps complexity

4. **ADR-004: API Versioning Strategy** (Task #4, Week 2)
   - URL-based vs Header-based vs Content-negotiation
   - Decision: URL-based (/v1/, /v2/)
   - Rationale: Simplicity, discoverability

5. **ADR-005: Message Queue Technology** (Task #4, Week 2)
   - Redis (BullMQ) vs RabbitMQ vs AWS SQS vs Kafka
   - Decision: BullMQ on Redis
   - Rationale: Leverage existing Redis, simpler ops

6. **ADR-006: AI Model Selection** (Task #4, Week 2)
   - OpenAI GPT-4 vs Claude vs self-hosted
   - Decision: OpenAI GPT-4
   - Rationale: Quality, reliability, structured output

7. **ADR-007: Frontend Framework** (Task #4, Week 3)
   - Next.js vs Remix vs SvelteKit
   - Decision: Next.js 14+
   - Rationale: React ecosystem, API routes, deployment options

8. **ADR-008: Testing Strategy** (Task #6, Week 4)
   - Testing pyramid, tools, coverage targets
   - Decision: TBD
   - Coverage target: 80%+

9. **ADR-009: Logging & Observability** (Task #7, Week 5)
   - ELK vs CloudWatch vs Datadog
   - Decision: TBD based on deployment platform
   - Must include: structured logging, distributed tracing

10. **ADR-010: Secrets Management** (Task #8, Week 5)
    - AWS Secrets Manager vs HashiCorp Vault vs Doppler
    - Decision: TBD
    - Must support: rotation, audit, RBAC

## ADR Lifecycle

### Creating an ADR

1. Copy ADR template
2. Number sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.)
3. Fill in all sections with detail
4. Include diagrams if helpful
5. Submit for review via pull request
6. Update this index

### ADR Status

- **Proposed**: Under review, not yet accepted
- **Accepted**: Approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended, but not yet replaced
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR (link to replacement)

### Reviewing ADRs

All ADRs must be reviewed by:
- Tech Lead (required)
- At least one senior engineer (required)
- Google Engineering Advisor (for major decisions)

### Updating ADRs

ADRs are immutable once accepted. If a decision changes:
1. Create a new ADR superseding the old one
2. Mark the old ADR as "Superseded by ADR-XXX"
3. Document why the decision changed

## Example ADR

See the PRD for a complete example ADR:
- **Location**: `.claude/prds/engineering-documentation.md` lines 1560-1727
- **Topic**: ADR-001: Database Selection for ARCA API
- **Demonstrates**: Complete structure with rationale, alternatives, consequences, cost estimation
