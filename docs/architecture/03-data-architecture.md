# Data Architecture

> **Status**: TODO - Pending completion in Task #3
>
> **Purpose**: Document database design, data models, caching strategy, and data flows

## TODO

This document will be completed in **Task #3: Write Core Architecture Documents** and will include:

### Planned Content

1. **Database Strategy**
   - Primary database choice (PostgreSQL) and rationale
   - Schema design approach
   - Partitioning strategy for scale
   - Read replica strategy
   - Backup and recovery procedures

2. **Data Models**
   - Entity-Relationship diagrams (Mermaid)
   - Core entities:
     - Users and authentication
     - ARCA certificates
     - Invoices (main entity)
     - Customers
     - API keys and rate limits
     - Webhooks
     - Audit logs
   - Relationships and constraints
   - Indexes and performance optimization

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Redis caching layers
   - Cache invalidation patterns
   - TTL policies
   - ARCA token caching (11-hour tokens, 10-hour cache)
   - API key validation caching
   - Performance targets (>90% hit rate)

4. **Data Flow Diagrams**
   - Invoice data lifecycle
   - Analytics aggregation pipeline
   - Audit log collection
   - Backup and archival flow

5. **Data Retention & Archival**
   - Invoice retention: 7 years (legal requirement)
   - Log retention: 90 days operational, 1 year audit
   - Archival strategy to cold storage

6. **Data Security**
   - Encryption at rest (AES-256)
   - Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
   - Column-level encryption for certificates
   - Row-level security for multi-tenancy
   - GDPR compliance (right to deletion, data export)
