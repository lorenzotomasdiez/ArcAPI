# Architecture Documentation

This section contains the system architecture documentation for ARCA API, following the C4 model (Context, Container, Component, Code) for visual representation and comprehensive architectural decision records.

## Overview

ARCA API is designed as a modern, cloud-native platform with multiple microservices orchestrated to provide a seamless electronic invoicing experience. The architecture prioritizes:

- **High Availability**: 99.95% uptime through multi-AZ deployment and failover
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling to support 100K+ invoices per day
- **Security**: ISO 27001 and GDPR compliance by design
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimized infrastructure with <$0.02 per invoice target
- **Maintainability**: Clear service boundaries and well-defined contracts

## Architecture Documents

### Core Architecture

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

[Architecture Decision Records](./adrs/README.md) document significant architectural decisions, including:

- Technology stack choices
- Database selection
- Authentication strategy
- Deployment platform
- Service communication patterns

## System Components

### Core Services

- **REST API Core**: Main API gateway handling all client requests
- **Dashboard**: Web-based user interface (Next.js)
- **AI Invoice Generator**: Natural language to structured invoice (Python/FastAPI)
- **Webhook Engine**: Event delivery system for real-time notifications
- **MCP Server**: LLM integration server for AI agent tools
- **Analytics Service**: Data aggregation and reporting
- **Integration Connectors**: Third-party integrations (Stripe, email, etc.)
- **ARCA SOAP Client**: Adapter for ARCA/AFIP SOAP API

### Infrastructure Components

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for transactional data
- **Redis**: Caching layer and session store
- **Message Queue**: Async job processing (BullMQ/Redis)
- **Object Storage**: PDF and file storage (S3-compatible)
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery and caching

### External Dependencies

- **ARCA/AFIP SOAP API**: Government tax authority system
- **OpenAI API**: AI invoice generation
- **Stripe**: Payment processing
- **Resend/SendGrid**: Transactional email
- **Cloudflare**: CDN and DDoS protection

## Design Principles

### Microservices Architecture

Services are designed with:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a clear, focused purpose
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via well-defined contracts
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use optimal technology stack

### API-First Design

- All services expose REST APIs with OpenAPI specifications
- Contracts defined before implementation
- Backward compatibility maintained through versioning
- Comprehensive error handling and status codes

### Event-Driven Patterns

- Asynchronous operations handled via message queues
- Webhook delivery for external integrations
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- Circuit breaker patterns for resilience

### Security by Design

- Zero-trust network architecture
- End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3)
- Secrets management with rotation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Quality Attributes

### Performance Targets

- **API Latency**: P95 <200ms (excluding ARCA calls)
- **Throughput**: Support 100K invoices/day (1,200 req/min peak)
- **Database**: P95 query latency <50ms
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90% for ARCA tokens

### Availability & Reliability

- **Uptime**: 99.95% SLA (4.38 hours downtime/year)
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Active-active in two availability zones
- **Auto-healing**: Automatic restart of failed services
- **Disaster Recovery**: RTO <1 hour, RPO <5 minutes

### Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scale based on CPU/memory metrics
- **Database**: Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- **Caching**: Multi-layer caching (Redis, CDN)
- **Load Balancing**: Application load balancer with health checks

### Security & Compliance

- **Authentication**: JWT-based API key authentication
- **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **GDPR**: Right to deletion, data export, consent management
- **Audit Logs**: All data access logged with retention
