# Infrastructure Architecture

> **Status**: TODO - Pending completion in Task #3
>
> **Purpose**: Document cloud infrastructure, deployment topology, scaling, and disaster recovery

## TODO

This document will be completed in **Task #3: Write Core Architecture Documents** and will include:

### Planned Content

1. **Infrastructure Overview**
   - Cloud provider choice and rationale
   - Multi-region strategy
   - Availability zone deployment
   - Network architecture

2. **Deployment Topology**
   - Mermaid diagram showing:
     - Load balancers
     - Application servers (multi-AZ)
     - Database (primary + standby)
     - Redis cluster
     - CDN layer
     - Monitoring/observability stack

3. **Compute Resources**
   - Container orchestration (Kubernetes/ECS)
   - Auto-scaling policies:
     - CPU threshold: >70% scale out
     - Memory threshold: >80% scale out
     - Min/max instance counts per service
   - Resource allocation per service (CPU, memory)

4. **High Availability**
   - Multi-AZ active-active deployment
   - Database replication (primary + standby)
   - Redis replication
   - Health checks and auto-healing
   - Load balancer configuration
   - Session affinity handling

5. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Recovery Time Objective (RTO): <1 hour
   - Recovery Point Objective (RPO): <5 minutes
   - Cross-region replication for database
   - Automated backups (daily snapshots)
   - Point-in-time recovery capability
   - Failover procedures

6. **Network Architecture**
   - VPC design
   - Public/private subnet strategy
   - Security groups and firewall rules
   - NAT gateway for outbound traffic
   - VPN/bastion for administrative access

7. **Cost Optimization**
   - Reserved instances for baseline load
   - Spot instances for batch jobs
   - Auto-scaling to match demand
   - Storage tiering (hot/warm/cold)
   - CDN caching to reduce origin traffic
   - Target: <$0.02 per invoice processed

8. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Metrics collection (Prometheus/CloudWatch)
   - Centralized logging (ELK/CloudWatch)
   - Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
   - Dashboard and alerting
   - SLO/SLI definitions
