# ARCA API - Engineering Documentation

Welcome to the ARCA API engineering documentation. This documentation system provides comprehensive technical specifications, architecture decisions, development workflows, and operational procedures for the ARCA API platform.

## Overview

ARCA API is an electronic invoicing platform for Argentina (ARCA/AFIP), providing a modern REST API that simplifies interaction with the government's SOAP-based invoicing system. The platform consists of 8+ interconnected services designed for high availability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

**Key Features:**
- REST API Core with AI-powered invoice generation
- Developer Dashboard and multiple language SDKs
- Webhook Engine for real-time notifications
- MCP Server for LLM integrations
- Analytics and Integration Connectors

## Documentation Structure

This documentation follows a hierarchical structure optimized for discoverability and maintainability:

### [Architecture](./architecture/README.md)

### [Flows](./flows/README.md)

Visual documentation of user flows, system flows, and data flows using Mermaid diagrams.

- User journeys and interaction flows
- System integration flows
- Data pipeline flows
- Deployment and CI/CD flows

### [Development](./development/README.md)

Developer setup, coding standards, testing strategies, and contribution guidelines.

- Local development setup
- Coding standards and best practices
- Testing strategy
- Git workflow and PR process

### [Operations](./operations/README.md)

Deployment guides, monitoring, incident response, and operational runbooks.

- **[Deployment Guides](./operations/README.md)** - Infrastructure provisioning and deployment
- **[Runbooks](./operations/runbooks/README.md)** - Step-by-step incident resolution procedures
- Monitoring and observability
- Disaster recovery

### [Security](./security/README.md)

Security architecture, compliance requirements, and security testing procedures.

- **[Security Architecture](./security/README.md)** - Authentication, encryption, secrets management
- **[Compliance](./security/compliance/README.md)** - GDPR, ISO 27001, audit requirements

## Quick Start

### For New Engineers

1. Start with **[Architecture Overview](./architecture/README.md)** to understand the system
2. Review **[API Specifications](./specifications/api/README.md)** for contract details
3. Follow **[Development Setup](./development/README.md)** to configure your environment
4. Review **[Flows](./flows/README.md)** to understand how the system works

**Goal:** Understand the complete system architecture within 2 days.

### For DevOps Engineers

1. Review **[Architecture - Infrastructure](./architecture/README.md)** for deployment topology
2. Follow **[Operations - Deployment Guide](./operations/README.md)** for provisioning
3. Configure **[Operations - Monitoring](./operations/README.md)** and alerting
4. Familiarize with **[Runbooks](./operations/runbooks/README.md)** for incident response

### For Security Reviewers

1. Review **[Security Architecture](./security/README.md)**
2. Verify **[Compliance](./security/compliance/README.md)** requirements
3. Review **[Architecture Decision Records](./architecture/adrs/README.md)** for security-related decisions
4. Check **[API Specifications](./specifications/api/README.md)** for authentication/authorization

## Documentation Principles

This documentation follows these core principles:

1. **Spec-Driven Development**: Specifications written before implementation
2. **Visual First**: Diagrams for all flows and architecture
3. **Technology Agnostic**: Focus on patterns and principles over specific technologies
4. **Always Current**: Documentation updated alongside code changes
5. **Discoverable**: Any topic reachable within 3 clicks from this page

## Documentation Standards

- All documents include: title, author, last updated, and status
- Diagrams use Mermaid format (version controllable)
- Cross-references use relative links
- Examples include code blocks with language tags
- Architecture follows C4 model (Context, Container, Component, Code)

## Quality Attributes

The ARCA API platform is designed for:

- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime target
- **Performance**: P95 latency <200ms for API calls
- **Scalability**: Support 100K+ invoices per day
- **Security**: ISO 27001 and GDPR compliant
- **Cost**: <$0.02 per invoice processed

## Contributing to Documentation

Documentation is maintained alongside code in this repository. All documentation changes:

- Must be reviewed via pull request
- Should include diagrams for complex topics
- Must validate (OpenAPI specs, Mermaid diagrams, broken links)
- Should follow the [documentation style guide](./development/README.md)
