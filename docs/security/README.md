# Security Documentation

Security architecture, compliance requirements, and security testing procedures for ARCA API.

## Overview

This section documents:
- Security architecture and controls
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, ISO 27001)
- Security testing and audit procedures
- Vulnerability management
- Incident response for security events

Security is built into ARCA API from the ground up, following defense-in-depth principles.

## Status

> **Status**: TODO - Pending completion in Task #8
>
> Security documentation will be created in **Task #8: Create Security Documentation** (Week 5)

## Planned Documents

### 1. Security Architecture (TODO - Task #8)

**File**: `security-architecture.md`

Comprehensive security design:

**Network Security:**
- Zero-trust network architecture
- VPC design with public/private subnets
- Security groups and NACLs
- DDoS protection (Cloudflare/AWS Shield)
- WAF rules for common attacks
- API rate limiting per IP/user

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- API key authentication (JWT-based)
- Service-to-service authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication for dashboard
- Session management
- Token expiration and renewal

**Data Encryption:**
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all connections
- **At Rest**: AES-256 for databases and files
- Certificate storage: Column-level encryption
- API keys: Hashed with bcrypt/Argon2
- Backup encryption

**Secrets Management:**
- HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- Automatic secret rotation
- No secrets in code or environment variables
- Audit logging for secret access
- Least privilege access

**API Security:**
- Input validation (prevent injection attacks)
- Output encoding (prevent XSS)
- CORS configuration
- Content Security Policy
- API versioning for security updates

**Certificate Management:**
- ARCA certificates encrypted at rest
- In-memory decryption only
- Automatic expiration monitoring
- Secure certificate upload (HTTPS only)
- Certificate revocation handling

### 2. Compliance Documentation (TODO - Task #8)

**Directory**: `compliance/`

Regulatory compliance implementation:

#### GDPR Compliance (`compliance/gdpr.md`)

- Data subject rights implementation
- Right to access: API endpoint for data export
- Right to deletion: Soft delete + anonymization
- Right to rectification: Update APIs
- Consent management: Explicit opt-in
- Data processing agreements: Template
- Data breach notification: <72 hour procedure
- Privacy by design: Architecture review

#### ISO 27001 (`compliance/iso27001.md`)

- Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- Risk assessment process
- Security controls implementation
- Access control policies
- Incident management
- Business continuity planning
- Internal audit procedures

#### Data Retention (`compliance/data-retention.md`)

- Invoice data: 7 years (legal requirement - Argentina)
- Operational logs: 90 days
- Audit logs: 1 year
- User data: Until account deletion
- Backup retention: 30 days
- Archival to cold storage

### 3. Security Testing (TODO - Task #8)

**File**: `security-testing.md`

Security validation procedures:

**Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**
- Tools: SonarQube, Semgrep
- Run on every commit (CI)
- Block deployment on critical findings
- Regular codebase scans

**Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**
- Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- Scan staging environment weekly
- Automated API security testing
- Manual testing before major releases

**Dependency Scanning:**
- npm audit, pip-audit
- Snyk or Dependabot
- Automated PR for updates
- Block high-severity vulnerabilities

**Penetration Testing:**
- Quarterly external penetration tests
- Annual comprehensive security audit
- Bug bounty program (post-launch)
- Report template and remediation process

**Security Code Review:**
- Security checklist for all PRs
- Focus areas:
  - Authentication/authorization
  - Input validation
  - SQL injection prevention
  - Sensitive data handling
  - Cryptography usage

### 4. Vulnerability Management (TODO - Task #8)

**File**: `vulnerability-management.md`

Process for handling security vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability Disclosure:**
- Security email: security@arcaapi.com
- Response SLA: 48 hours
- Fix timeline:
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 30 days
  - Medium: 90 days
  - Low: Next sprint

**Patching Process:**
- Dependency updates: Weekly review
- Critical patches: Emergency deployment
- Testing: Staging â†’ Production
- Communication: Security advisories

**CVE Management:**
- Monitor CVE databases
- Assess impact to ARCA API
- Prioritize patching
- Document in security log

### 5. Incident Response (TODO - Task #8)

**File**: `security-incident-response.md`

Security incident handling:

**Incident Classification:**
- **P0**: Active breach, data loss
- **P1**: Vulnerability exploitation
- **P2**: Suspicious activity
- **P3**: Potential vulnerability

**Response Procedure:**
1. **Detect**: Alerts, reports, monitoring
2. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Investigate**: Determine scope and impact
4. **Eradicate**: Remove threat
5. **Recover**: Restore systems
6. **Learn**: Post-mortem and improvements

**Communication:**
- Internal: Security team, executives
- External: Affected customers, regulators
- Timeline: GDPR 72-hour notification

**Forensics:**
- Preserve evidence
- Log analysis
- Root cause determination
- Legal considerations

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of security:
- Network security (firewall, WAF)
- Application security (input validation, auth)
- Data security (encryption, access control)
- Monitoring and alerting

### 2. Least Privilege

- Users have minimum required permissions
- Services have scoped access
- Time-limited credentials
- Regular access reviews

### 3. Secure by Default

- Encryption enabled by default
- Secure configuration out of the box
- Opt-in for data sharing
- Safe defaults for all settings

### 4. Zero Trust

- Verify every request
- No implicit trust
- Continuous authentication
- Micro-segmentation

### 5. Privacy by Design

- Minimal data collection
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Transparency

## Security Tools

### Required Tools

- **SAST**: SonarQube, Semgrep
- **DAST**: OWASP ZAP
- **Dependency Scanning**: Snyk, Dependabot
- **Secrets Detection**: GitGuardian, TruffleHog
